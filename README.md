# HugoLabs, a Hugo demo website by NickoLabs.com
This was more like an experiment at exporting Wordpress content to HUGO, as well as testing out the architecture behind it.
I used the Agency Hugo Theme, which you can see in the themes/hugolabs-theme/readme.md file, as a base for my experiment and added a very basic blog to it.
